        <h2>The Advantages of CSS</h2>
        
        <h2>3 Key Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first advantage of CSS is that it allows you to keep HTML structure separate from styling (colors, fonts, etc) in order to keep things more organized and clean.</li>
            <li class="news">The second advantage of CSS is that its file doesn't need to be downloaded again for other pages because external CSS files can be cached by browsers.</li>
            <li>The third advantage of CSS is that the file can control the appearance of an entire website!</li>
        </ul>
