    <h1>CSS Advantages</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Separation of content and presentation - CSS allows you to keep HTML structure separate from styling, making code more maintainable and organized.</li>
        <li class="news">Improved website performance - External CSS files can be cached by browsers, reducing load times for subsequent page visits.</li>
        <li>Consistent styling across multiple pages - One CSS file can control the appearance of an entire website, ensuring visual consistency.</li>
        <li>Responsive design capabilities - CSS provides tools like media queries to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
    </ul>
